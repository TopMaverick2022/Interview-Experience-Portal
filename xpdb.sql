Scoring more than 50 % I guess you would be eligible for the next technical round.Some say this is not an elimination round as well but for the safer side score at least 50 %.Questions are average level on your primary skills. Pass this exam with more than 70% then if you join Accenture later it can be beneficial for you on a financial basis.

Document uploading is very irritating process which Accenture and all follow its like you will get 4 to 5 calls in one day and each and every call will ask you to correct here and there in form over Accenture portal .\r\nOn very first stage be very clear what your current salary and what is your expected salary to your HR and explicitly ask if their budget falls under your criteria sometimes they will promote you till document stage and then HR will inform you that sorry our budget is what you are withdrawing currently in your organization would you like to procced ?

I was on a bus, returning from college, when I checked my inbox and saw the mail. My heart raced with excitement as I read through the details. Google had asked me to confirm my interest by filling out a form and scheduling an interview. It was a dream come true—the kind of moment every aspiring software engineer hopes for.\r\n\r\nInitial Steps: Setting the Stage\r\nAfter filling out the form with my qualifications and preferred interview dates, I received confirmation for November 11, 2024. Google also scheduled a virtual briefing for all selected candidates on November 5, where we learned about the process: four technical rounds focused on problem-solving and coding skills.\r\n\r\nI began preparing intensely right away. Over the next ten days, I sharpened my skills, focusing on the LeetCode Blind 75 problems—a resource I discovered through LinkedIn connections with experienced candidates. I also revisited concepts from Love Babbar’s DSA course, prioritizing topics like graphs and trees to prepare for any challenging question.\r\n\r\nAn Unexpected Twist\r\nOn the morning of November 11, I received an unexpected email: my interview had been canceled due to a scheduling conflict and rescheduled for November 21, 2024. While initially disappointed, I saw it as an opportunity to refine my preparation further. Despite some personal commitments that week, including a family function, I balanced my time to stay focused on coding practice and theoretical revisions.\r\n\r\nThe Interview Experience\r\nAt 3 PM on November 21, I logged in for my first technical round. The interviewer was friendly and began with an introduction. Soon, he presented a problem based on arrays and intervals. I explained two different approaches, analyzing their time and space complexities. The discussion went well, and we moved on to the coding task.\r\n\r\nHowever, I made a minor mistake in my code. Despite a subtle hint from the interviewer, I couldn’t resolve it within the allotted time. The interview concluded with a chance for me to ask questions, which I used to express genuine interest in the role.\r\n\r\nThe Outcome: A Bitter Disappointment\r\nLater that evening, I received an email informing me I wouldn’t be moving forward in the process. It was disheartening to see my Google journey end so soon. However, I chose to view it as a valuable learning experience. The setback highlighted the importance of effective time management and avoiding errors under pressure.\r\n\r\nReflection and Lessons Learned\r\n\r\nWhile rejection stings, it also fuels determination. Here’s what I’ve taken away from this experience:\r\n\r\nPractice under time constraints: I’ll focus more on hands-on coding practice within strict time limits.\r\nStrengthen fundamentals: Topics like arrays, graphs, and trees will be revisited more thoroughly.\r\nLearn from mistakes: I aim to approach future interviews with better composure and time management.\r\nSetbacks are an inevitable part of any journey. They’re not the end but stepping stones toward growth and success. To anyone preparing for similar opportunities: stay consistent, keep learning, and never give up on your dreams. The road to success is rarely smooth, but perseverance always pays off.\r\n\r\n', '2024-12-30 13:35:51', '2024-12-30 13:35:51'),

Each section tested a different aspect of communication, evaluating clarity of expression and the ability to articulate thoughts in English.\r\n\r\nSuggestions: Regularly practice speaking in English on various topics to improve fluency and articulation. Reading comprehension exercises and listening to English media can help sharpen language skills.\r\n\r\nRound 3: Technical Interview (Business Round)\r\nIn this technical round, also referred to as the business round, the interviewer asked questions to assess core technical knowledge. Topics included Java programming concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, exception handling, and file handling. Additionally, there were questions on SQL, such as writing basic queries for JOINs, GROUP BY, and aggregate functions. Questions also covered the difference between linked lists and arrays and paging in operating systems.
